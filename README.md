Seeing my friend compile results of over 50 students by hand, I decided to develop this app. I started this project by writing this script [resultCompiler](https://github.com/abdulwaliyahaya/resultCompiler) which is a python class for doing all the compilation and computing. This web app is the concluding part where I incorporate this python class to build a web application using the django web framwork
