# resultLab
A result management system for primary and secondary schools in Nigeria
# Motivation
The way results are been compiled in most schools in Nigeria is hectic, tiring and error prone. I have been there, I know how it feels. I'm currently serving in a school in Gombe. Seeing my friend compile results of over 50 students by hand, I decided to develop this app. I started this project by writing this script [resultCompiler](https://github.com/abdulwaliyahaya/resultCompiler) which is a python class for doing all the compilation and computing. This web app is the concluding part where I incorporate this python class to build a web application using the django web framwork
# Features
- compile student results by calculating student positions for each subject and overall.
- store compiled result for future reference

# How To Run This App
To use this web app, clone the repository. With the aid of your command prompt, navigate to the folder. run `python manage.py runserver`.

After the development server starts, visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` on your browser.
